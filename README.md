The orbits might be a bit confusing because of the angle, but all the plants we see  
orbits in the same plane except for pluto which you will see at the end. If you are  
familiar with python there is a link below so you can download it, play the animation,  
and drag the picture around in different angles to see it clearer. You could also  
see some plants which we dont see here, Neptune and Uranus.
