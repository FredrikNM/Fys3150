  
Download all files and write make in the cmd/console.
    
# Run

Then you write :
```
./runme
```

and the program gives you alternatives. 

# Another possibility is to give commandline inputs

Write 
```
./runme 1
```
which will give you an error and tell you what you can input.

# Parallelization

It did go a lot work in to parallelize the code, with 3 different methods of doing it. In the work to implement it time got lost and the code ended up with some memory leak. On the other hand, if you would like to see how you can use OMP to parallelize your code, the different "void MMC" methods is well explained and contains most of the variables inside so it should be easy to follow as well.
